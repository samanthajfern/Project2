# Project2
Project 2 for my web development class

 This particular API (NYT times best sellers) does not have many reviews to work with, I put the .get to TRY to avoid getting a Key index error, which displays None instead.
 This API was one of the only ones I was interested in, which is why I decided to keep with it, but the lack of data didn't help. 

### The project still has all the required functionality.
